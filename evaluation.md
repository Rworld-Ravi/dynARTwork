# Evaluation
The document needs to describe the evaluation methodology for both the overall system as well as each individual components for the technical/user dimensions, e.g. by defining specific performance indicators that will be measured, tools that will be used.

## User Experience
Describe the situation:

| #    | Attribute              | Examples                                                |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Product                | *Webapp*                                                |
| 2    | Design Stage           | Concept design, prototyping, on market                  |
| 3    | Product representation | Storyboard, Flash animation                             |
| 4    | Purpose of evaluation  | Find best design alternative                            |
| 5    | Study location         | Usability lab, Online study, partecipants' daily env.   |
| 6    | Participants           | UX experts, all visitors, kids (with parents)           |
| 7    | Time restrictions      | 3 months, 1 week, lunch hour (from assigment to result) |
| 8    | Equipment, tools       | special sensors, Remote video, logging tool             |
| 9    | Skill of researchers   | Anthropologist, statistician, students                  |
|      |                        |                                                         |

The project will select one of the ideas (described by storyboards) based on four criteria:

1. Potential impact in energy saving *(in our case is different)*
2. Technical feasibility
3. Cost of the system
4. User Experience

### Collecting UXEMs

UX evaluation methods can be categorized in various **categories**:

- who are the participants: *experts, users, groups*
- time restrictions: *1 day,..., several months*
- Expertise required: *special skills of researchers*
- Place of evaluation: *lab, field, online*
- data type: *quantitative, qualitative*
- Period of experience: moment, episode, overall UX
- Product development phase, concept, prototype, ready product
