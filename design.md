## Product/Service from the user point of view

Francesco has to curate an exhibition at the MAXXI Museum in Rome.
The theme of the exhibition is innovation in the modern age. He wants to create a work of art that highlights the negative aspects of innovation.
He wants to use technology and therefore innovation to do this, but he doesn't have the means.

On the contrary, our team is capable of using technology, but does not know how to give an artistic touch.
We will create an architecture that allows Francesco to take data inside the museum or outside (in the city or around the world) and we will apply this data in realtime to a static works of art.

*So what will we do?*
We will create a website (frontend) where Francesco can easily register and create his work of art.

He will upload an image of an existing painting / work that he wants to modify (it can be made from scratch for this specific purpose or it can be an existing work). Then he will upload a simple jpg.

At the next stage,  he will choose from a list of the data he is interested in between:
- atmospheric data
- demographic data
- data on childhood deaths
- China data, Europe data, museum data
In this case he will take the atmospheric data (Co2) to highlight the negative aspects of innovation in today's world.

He will not have to do anything now.
Our Machine learning algorithm will deal with mixing the image with the data chosen as input.

Francesco will see a live demo on his screen where he can see in real-time what he has accomplished.

After 1 month and different trials, Francesco is ready to exhibit at MAXII then we configure the sensors and we will connect a device to a projector that will take care of showing the dynamic work created by Francesco (with our technological support).

We are both happy, Francesco can boast of having created a work of art using artificial intelligence through a simple website.
On the other hand, We are happy because otherwise we would have used the Internet of Things and Machine Learning only for gaming on our laptop.

Finally, in the day of the exhibition, visitors will arrive and can enjoy the dynamic work we created without worrying about anything,
but reflecting on global warming due to innovation.
